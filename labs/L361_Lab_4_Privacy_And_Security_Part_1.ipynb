Having explored standard FL, data heterogeneity and device heterogeneity, we now focus on one of FL's main selling points: privacy.\n","\n","The two methods for achieving privacy we will explore are client-level [**Differential Privacy**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9069945) and [**Secure Aggregation**](https://research.google/pubs/pub45808/). Intuitively, the **first** provides statistical guarantees on how distinguishable a single client's pseudo-gradient is compared to the aggregated pseudo-gradient without its contribution.\n","\n","<!-- a probabilistic bound on how distinct the final model trained using the data of a given client would be from the same model trained without data from that client (thus if a client contains all samples from a given class, it should be difficult for the model to predict that class as it would have to violate DP).  -->\n","\n","In an ideal privacy scenario, we would prefer it if two global models trained with or without the data of a given client were indistinguishable.\n","The **second** is a cryptography-based solution that effectively erases the ability to identify a client during aggregation by encrypting all client model updates to produce the correct aggregate when summed.\n","\n","As these topics are pretty in-depth, we will not cover them to the same level of detail as previous labs concerning theoretical subjects (such as data heterogeneity in lab 2). This lab will be primarily experimental to test the algorithms put into practice. We will, however, begin with a light introduction. Suppose you are interested in learning more about the subject. In that case, we may recommend the following papers [Deep Learning with Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00133.pdf) \\[1], [Learning Differentially Private Recurrent Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06963.pdf) \\[2] and [Differentially private learning with adaptive clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03871) \\[3] on the DP front. For secure aggregation consider the original paper [Practical Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning on User-Held Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04482.pdf) \\[4] and the improved [LightSecAgg](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14236) \\[5].\n","\n","Secure aggregation does not harm the model's accuracy and demands only increased communication. Any samples involved in training may still be reconstructed in an attack; however, knowing who contributed the samples will not be possible. Thus, while the implementation is complex, its behaviour is predictable and shall be reserved for the end of the notebook as we are only concerned with measuring communication costs and answering conceptual questions. As such, let us dive into Differential Privacy after the following well-known imports.\n","\n","> **Important** The entire notebook has been tested in a GPU-enabled Google Colab environment, which runs at around 6 minutes per FL experiment. All experiments require you to vary at most one parameter at a time, so please use a for loop to generate a list of histories rather than trying to manage multiple cells---most experiments rely on one run we create for demonstration purposes to cover one of the desire parameter values. We have purposefully reduced the size of the federated test set significantly and have also reduced the overall number of clients used during FL experimentation. If you are more constrained in your resources (e.g., you have run out of Google accounts that can get a GPU or you get an error peculiar to your exact colab machine), let us know either on Slack or in your submission, and we will either help you set up the code locally, potentially provide you with history objects, or offer take this into account during marking.\n","\n","Citations:\n","\n","1.

However, their algorithm for DP protects against even adversaries with full knowledge of the training procedure, access to the parameters and potential control over parts of the dataset.\n","\n","Their **definition** of DP is as follows: a randomised mechanism $M: D ⟶ R$ (a neural network training procedure, in our case) satisfies $(ϵ,δ)$-differential privacy for any $S⊆R$ (a subset of outputs in the range $R$) if $Pr[M(d) \\in S] \\leq e^{\\epsilon} Pr[M(d') \\in S] + \\delta$ holds, where $d∈D$ and $d'∈D$ are adjacent sets (datasets) of the same domain $D$ (set of all the possible datasets), i.e., they differ by only one record (a training sample, in our case). We can **interpret** this as stating that the probability of getting a particular output from our model when not including a specific sample should be close to the probability of getting the same output had we not included the sample. Specifically, when $\\epsilon=0$, the two probabilities are equal, and it is impossible to find out if that sample was included in the training set. The bigger $\\epsilon$ is the lower protection is. The probability that the model produces different outputs when trained on adjacent datasets increases exponentially with $\\epsilon$.\n","\n","> Importantly, the original definition of DP and the one you may have encountered before only contained the exponential term _without the_ $\\delta$; however, this resulted in _very strong requirements_ for not breaking privacy. This new form, $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ privacy relaxed the requirement. Informally, it can be interpreted as allowing privacy at a given $\\epsilon$ level to be broken with _probability_ $1-\\delta$. We do not have the scale of experimentation necessary to consider both in this lab, as such we will focus on $\\epsilon$ values at the detriment of analysing changes in $\\delta$. For the experiments in this lab, you can consider DP to be defined entirely in terms of ϵ. Formally, the transition to $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ delta was necessary to move from an inefficient noise generation mechanism to Gaussian noise as ML models are much more complex than typical vector-valued functions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-QwrOIl5_SK8"},"source":["Differentially private **approximations** of functions are usually **constructed** by the addition of noise proportional to the sensitivity of the function---think of it as the maximal impact that the addition or removal of a data point can have upon the output of the function. From now on, we shall refer to this noise level as the **`noise_multiplier`** as it scales the noise multiplicatively based on the sensitivity. When DP was extended to a DL context, making the system differentially private by intervening upon the gradients used during training rather than the final model was significantly more straightforward than operating on the model as a function after training. In the context of ML model updates (gradient descent steps or pseudo-gradients in FL), their sensitivity is generally defined in terms of the l2 norm (when noise is Gaussian) of the update, and the noise is thus scaled based on this norm.\n","\n","As such, the **original DP-SGD** operates as follows:\n","\n","1.  _Compute_ the derivative concerning each sample (not minibatch).\n","2.  _Clip_ the L2 norm of the derivative so it falls below a given bound.\n","3.  _Aggregate_ these clipped derivatives and _add_ Gaussian _noise_ to obfuscate the impact of specific samples used to compute the gradients. Here, the noise is proportional to the L2 bound.\n","\n","Suppose we reframe DP to the original context of databases and records. In that case, the larger the number of noisy answers the database offers, the more an attacker can eliminate the noise by looking at the entire distribution of answers. Similarly, the more samples out of the total an ML model sees (or the more times it sees the same sample), the more the noise of the sample gradients average out. For a model to be trained for an extended period, it is thus necessary to use a higher `noise_multiplier`. We shall soon extend this trade-off to clients within an FL context.\n","\n","While this process operates reasonably in the context of centralised, applying DP-SGD on every client in FL is **problematic**, given the reduced efficiency of the training method. As a result of this inefficiency, the federated model will likely incur significant drops in its already low performance. Furthermore, multiple studies have confirmed that applying DP locally has disastrous effects on the accuracy of the final federated model.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dMV6nFEaszzq"},"source":["# 3.User-level Differential Privacy\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UjeLJSKrGTk9"},"source":["Differential privacy at a client/user level in FL follows the same **definition**, except adjacent datasets are constructed by adding or removing all samples from a given client. Thus, under _maximum privacy scenarios_, with $\\epsilon=0$ and $\\delta=0$, two models should behave identically regardless of the presence of a specific user in the federation. For user-level DP, training with more users (rather than samples) results in the degradation of privacy. Thus, the **`noise_multiplier`** necessary to make an FL system differentially private with respect to an L2 norm bound depends on the total number of users, the number of users sampled every round and the number of rounds.\n","\n","**DP-FedAvg** represents a reasonably direct analogue to DP-SGD as it applies the same process to FL pseudo-gradients that DP-SGD applies to gradients generated by one sample. Namely, it clips the gradients based on the L2 norm on the local client after training. The server then adds Gaussian noise related to the L2 norm bound via the `noise_multiplier` when it receives the gradients.\n","\n","However, this extension is hampered by the fact that DP-SGD assumes an IID distribution of samples. As we, clients in FL contain **non-IID data** and have skewed numbers of samples. As such, for the theoretical privacy guarantee to hold DP-FedAvg **must assume** that _clients will not drop_ out and that the overall set of available clients in the population is static---both being significant limitations. Furthermore, _unweighted aggregation_ is usually enforced since weighted aggregation is more likely to leak data from a specific user. An _additional note_ worth making is that even when violating the theoretical assumptions of DP, applying noise and clipping gradients is still likely to make reconstructing data belonging to a specific client more difficult in practice.\n","\n","One final theoretical concern worth addressing prior to experimentation is the **nature of the L2 norm clipping**. Two specific _questions_ arise in the early works discussing DP-FedAvg:\n","\n","- Should the clipping be done per layer or uniformly across the entire model? Consider scenarios where a single large layer encodes all the relevant information about a specific user and is not clipped because the overall L2 norm of the gradient is lower than a generic bound.\n","- How should a L2 bound be chosen and changed? If the model updates are too small, the model is less likely to learn. However, a more oversized bound implies more noise and thus leads to potential degradation yet again.\n","\n","These questions have been answered by follow-up work. On the _first point_, this stack overflow answer by one of the authors of paper \\[3] above indicates that per-layer bounding leads to worse performance as it is harsher for little benefit. On the _second point_, methods for efficiently tracking a given quantile of the L2 distribution amongst client updates were proposed in \\[3].

When it is used to tackle data heterogeneity, it limits the divergence of highly heterogeneous clients. In the context of privacy, more significant updates are likely to come from either larger or more heterogeneous clients. Thus, when combined with unweighted aggregation, norm clipping stabilises training. However, it may slow down improvements in accuracy.\n","\n","> It is important to note that, theoretically, the triangle inequality assures us that the overall federated model update will have a norm below `clip_norm`.\n","\n","You will now examine the effects of norm-clipping on model accuracy irrespective of noise.\n","\n","1.

Modify the client `fit` function to return in the metrics dictionary the L2 norm of the model update **prior** to clipping. Finally, compute the mean $\\mu$ of the L2 norms from all of the 50 clients.

As computing such a value would be computationally expensive and require clients to send private values, the paper proposes an algorithm meant to approximate the quantile.\n","\n","Specifically, it adjusts the `clip_norm` parameter as:\n","\n",">     self.clip_norm *= math.exp(-self.clip_norm_lr\n","\n","            * (noised_clients_with_clipped_norm_fraction - self.clip_norm_target_quantile)\n","        )\n","\n","where the new clip norm depends on a learning rate, the fraction of clients used in training who have clipped their norms (with added noise), and the target quantile. In the code below, the clients who have clipped their norm are reported via a set bit in the config, and thus `noised_clients_with_clipped_norm_fraction` is replaced with `noised_norm_bit_set_fraction`. By knowing approximately how many clients fall below a given norm, we can iteratively improve the `clip_norm` until the percentage of clients with norms smaller than the bound is reached.\n","\n","The new implementation is hard to use and balance for short experiments such as ours as it includes an initial phase where the norm grows exponentially in its attempts to converge to the actual quantile. Given that we do not want any further interference making the behaviour of DP harder to predict, this would prove inconvenient when trying to deduce the impact of noise. As such, we shall only track the behaviour of the adaptive norm and use the predictable `DPFedAvgFixed` when experimenting with obtaining a given level of $\\epsilon$
